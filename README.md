## ‚ú® Project Overview

This project, "Learning HTML & CSS," is a hands-on journey I embarked on to solidify my understanding of core web technologies while diving deeper into the powerful capabilities of **Next.js**. My primary goal was to gain practical experience building a web application from the ground up, focusing on a robust frontend foundation and modern development practices.

It's primarily an educational endeavor, helping me get more familiar with the Next.js framework and how it orchestrates HTML, CSS, and data fetching for dynamic web experiences.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Key Features

This project leverages a modern and efficient set of technologies to deliver a clean and responsive user interface:

  * **HTML & CSS:** The foundational building blocks of the web, ensuring semantic structure and elegant styling.
  * **TypeScript:** Bringing type safety and improved developer experience to the JavaScript codebase.
  * **React:** The core UI library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
  * **Next.js:** The powerful React framework enabling server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and routing for optimized performance and development speed.
  * **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent styling, allowing for highly customizable designs directly in the markup.
  * **shadcn/ui components:** Utilizing beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable UI components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
  * **Lucide React:** A versatile icon library for adding clear and consistent visual cues throughout the application.
  * **Fake API Integration:** The project fetches post data from a locally built fake API, demonstrating effective client-side data retrieval and state management. (This showcases basic data fetching logic\!)
